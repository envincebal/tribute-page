						<p>John F. Kennedy, also known as JFK, was the second oldest of 9 children born to Joseph Patrick Kennedy and Rose Eleizabeth Fitzgerald-Kennedy. He is the brother of fellow politicians, Senators Ted Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, who was also later assassinated.</p>

						<p>Before his career in politics, Kennedy served in the US Navy from 1941-1945. Among his military awards include the Purple Heart Medal, the American Campaign Medala nd the World War II Victory Medal. He retired from the Navy Reserve and was honorably discharges witht he rank of lieutenant.</p>

						<p>In 1953, Kennedy married Jacqueline Bouvier, one year after being elected US Senator from Massachusetts.</p>

						<p>Kennedy launched his bid for the presidency in 1960. He defeated Lyndon B. Johnson during the Democratic primaries, who would later serve as his vice-present. With the nomination clinched, he ran against then-vice president and Republican nominee Richard Nixon. The both of them participated in the first televised presidential debate in US history. Kennedy would come out narrowly defeating Nixon in one of the closest presidential races in history, winning by a mere two-tenths of a percent in the popular vote. He became the youngest president ever to be elected at age 43.</p>

						<p>President Kennedy play a central role in averting the Cuban Missile Crisis, an event that brought the world closer to nuclear war any point before or ever since. US spy planes intercepted evidence that the Soviet Union was placing missile sites in Cuba. The resolution resulted in the USSR agreeing to remove its missile sites from Cuba, while the US agreed to never invade Cuba. In the aftermath, Kennedy enjoyed a sharp boost in approval ratings.</p>

						<p>On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald while on a trip to Dallas, Texas. He became the youngest president to die as of this writing. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetary. To this day he ranks highly in approval raitings by historians and the American people.</p>
